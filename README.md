# Five Letter Word Guess

## A shameless clone of the ever-popular game W****e

This project came to be from my desire to gain exposure to Blazor - specifically its WebAssembly model - and then progressed into a PWA to enable offline play on desktop/laptops and monile devices.

It uses the following [MudBlazor](https://mudblazor.com) components:

- MudDialog
- MudChart
- Snackbar
- MudAppBar
- MudIconButton
- ...and a few others.

### Features

- Totally self-contained, once installed it does not need to connect to a server.
- All words are stored in the code
- Two wordlists, one with more "common" five letter words, the other with some pretty esoteric words.
- Records stats regarding number of wins vs losses, current win streak, and guesses taken to find the correct word.
